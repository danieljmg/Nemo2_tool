config CONFIG_SSL_EXPIRY_TIME
    int "Session expiry time (in hours)"
    depends on !CONFIG_SSL_SKELETON_MODE
    default 24 
    help
        The time (in hours) before a session expires. 
        
        A longer time means that the expensive parts of a handshake don't 
        need to be run when a client reconnects later.

        The default is 1 day.

config CONFIG_X509_MAX_CA_CERTS
    int "Maximum number of certificate authorites"
    default 150
    depends on !CONFIG_SSL_SERVER_ONLY && !CONFIG_SSL_SKELETON_MODE
    help
        Determines the number of CA's allowed. 

        Increase this figure if more trusted sites are allowed. Each
        certificate adds about 300 bytes (when added).

        The default is to allow the Debian cert bundle to be parsed.

config CONFIG_SSL_MAX_CERTS
    int "Maximum number of chained certificates"
    default 3
    help
        Determines the number of certificates used in a certificate
        chain. The chain length must be at least 1.

        Increase this figure if more certificates are to be added to the 
        chain. Each certificate adds about 300 bytes (when added).

        The default is to allow one certificate + 2 certificates in the chain.

config CONFIG_HTTP_PORT
    int "HTTP port"
    default 80
    help
        The port number of the normal HTTP server. 

        You must be a root user in order to use the default port.

config CONFIG_HTTP_HTTPS_PORT
    int "HTTPS port"
    default 443
    help
        The port number of the HTTPS server.

        You must be a root user in order to use the default port.

config CONFIG_HTTP_SESSION_CACHE_SIZE
    int "SSL session cache size"
    default 5
    help
        The size of the SSL session cache.
        
        This is not actually related to the number of concurrent users, but 
        for optimum performance they should be the same (with a penalty 
        in memory usage).

config CONFIG_HTTP_TIMEOUT
    int "Timeout"
    default 300
    help
        Set the timeout of a connection in seconds.

        The minimum number of components needed before Karasuba muliplication
        is used.
 
        This is very dependent on the speed/implementation of bi_add()/
        bi_subtract(). There is a bit of trial and error here and will be
        at a different point for different architectures.

    help    
        The minimum number of components needed before Karatsuba squaring
        is used.
 
        This is very dependent on the speed/implementation of bi_add()/
        bi_subtract(). There is a bit of trial and error here and will be
