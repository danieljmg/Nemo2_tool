config GZIP_FAST
	int "Trade memory for speed (0:small,slow - 2:fast,big)"
	default 0
	range 0 2
	depends on GZIP
	help
	Enable big memory options for gzip.
	0: small buffers, small hash-tables
	1: larger buffers, larger hash-tables
	2: larger buffers, largest hash-tables
	Larger models may give slightly better compression

config FEATURE_VI_MAX_LEN
	int "Maximum screen width"
	range 256 16384
	default 4096
	depends on VI
	help
	Contrary to what you may think, this is not eating much.
	Make it smaller than 4k only if you are very limited on memory.

config FEATURE_VI_UNDO_QUEUE_MAX
	int "Maximum undo character queue size"
	default 256
	range 32 65536
	depends on FEATURE_VI_UNDO_QUEUE
	help
	This option sets the number of bytes used at runtime for the queue.
	Smaller values will create more undo objects and reduce the amount
	of typed or backspaced characters that are grouped into one undo
	operation; larger values increase the potential size of each undo
	and will generally malloc() larger objects and less frequently.
	Unless you want more (or less) frequent "undo points" while typing,
	you should probably leave this unchanged.

config FEATURE_KILL_DELAY
	int "How long to wait between TERM and KILL (0 - send TERM only)" if FEATURE_KILL_REMOVED
	range 0 1024
	default 0
	depends on FEATURE_KILL_REMOVED
	help
	With nonzero setting, init sends TERM, forks, child waits N
	seconds, sends KILL and exits. Setting it too high is unwise
	(child will hang around for too long and could actually kill
	the wrong process!)

config LAST_ID

	Last valid uid or gid for adduser and addgroup

	default 256
	range 256 20000
	depends on SYSLOGD
	help
	This option sets the size of the syslog read buffer.
	Actual memory usage increases around five times the
	change done here.
